# Swatches 

This simple Sketch 3 plugin will generate a palette of color swatches for you. It doesn't do a _whole_ lot, but it's handy for style guides, and it now works for Sketch version 3.2. This project was developed for the fantastic folks over at [Pixel Union](https://www.pixelunion.net/). <h1>THIS PLUGIN DON'T WORK WITH THE LAST VERSION OF SKETCH 3. PLEASE PEOPLE CONTRIBUIT FOR WORK.<h1>

Just run the plugin, enter comma-separated hex values, hit "OK", and it'll generate a 130 x 130 pixel rectangle filled with that color, a name label for you to change, and both hexadecimal and RGB values along the bottom. Pretty simple.
